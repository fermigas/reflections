When would you want to create a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work
When you want others to be able to contribute
When you want a backup


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are repositories cloned to your own github
collection of repositories.  It allows you to make 
changes and keep those changes on github without 
changing the original repository.   You can still
make a pull request to the original owner's 
repository, though.  

While a fork is a clone, a clone to your local
git is not a fork.  As you make changes, you 
push them to the original site or to a fork 
you've made.   Clones are the primary means of
getting source.  

A branch is a part of a repository.  It allow one
to make changes without affecting the main branch,
which is good for experimentation or working on
a part of an application that the changes may
make unstable for a while. It's similar to a 
fork in that it contains all of the code, but 
it is different in that it is always meant to
merge to or from the master branch.   A fork
might never rejoin its origin.
