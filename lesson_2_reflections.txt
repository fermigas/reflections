What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do 
you need to do it?  

A dircetory named .git is created.  It holds metadata
about your repository.   

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?  

It contains files that will be added in the next commit.  
This allows you to work on all files knowing that only
the added files will be added to the repository at the
next commit.
